### explainition of project
-this project is simple expert system android application ,tried to help in some life first aids
**how does worked**
-*this project use:python 3 ,android by java ,gradle (groovy)*
-i have learned from CS50 course making simple expert system in python using **propositional logic**
-then made many modules use it for some firstaids :bleeding,diabetes,burn
-all code of modules are collected in python/code_jupyter.ipynp {this only for see python but actually python for project in
seperate .py files in the android place}
-then i used chaquopy api to connect python to android
-**android files**
-i have tried to make code orgainzed in clean way ,seperate python from activity from working code
-result_utils:this is java class (not activity) for orgainizing always used function (help reduce redundency)
-show_first_aid:this is empty of info activity ,it's rule is to show in organized way data sent to it

### requirement to run
android 8

### important notes
i have tried to make no mistakes in firstaid but uptil now it has not been revised by medical org

### limations:
-some screens may not display well (i tried to solve it in xmls but still found)
-of some inputs may produce unexpected results

### resources used
[CS50](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50AI+1T2020/home)
-FirstAid faculty course Dr amany youssef sharaf 

### faq
-you may find that uses of expert system in firstaid is not actually in important things this is because :i  tried to get requirements from lectures i 
studied but this i have got only as i'm not specialized in firstaid ,another reason is that some need fuzzy logic not propositional logic as i use
